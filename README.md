# Cocos2DPerlinNoiseOcean

Cocos2DPerlinNoiseOcean is a test I did for an interview.  The test was to create a 3D ocean within Cocos2D-x so I've generated the ocean mesh with OpenGL and written some shaders to make it looks nicer.  Ocean was animated by moving vertices in vertex shader with perlin noise and sin waves, but later changed to use simplex noise.  So the repo name is actually inaccurate now and should be called SimplexNoiseOcean.  As this is done with a simple mesh and a simple shader, performance cost is relatively cheap and this should run in low end mobile devices that supports OpenGLES 2.0.
